                <h4>Flexible modern language courses</h4>
                <p>Our evening language courses are split into ability levels from complete beginner through to advanced
                    learners.
                    Each language level is divided into four six-week modules designed to follow smoothly on from each
                    other to give a clear sense of progression.
                    Our modern language modules allow you to take language learning as far as you want to - from a
                    single 6 week course to as many modules in a level as you need.</p>
