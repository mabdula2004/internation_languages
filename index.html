            <h4>Flexible modern language courses</h4>
            <p>Our evening language courses are split into ability levels from complete beginner through to advanced
                learners.
                Each language level is divided into four six-week modules designed to follow smoothly on from each
                other to give a clear sense of progression.
                Our modern language modules allow you to take language learning as far as you want to - from a
                single 6 week course to as many modules in a level as you need.</p>

            <p>I feel the programs offered are excellent! Look…, I’m 65 years old. The older you are the more
                difficult
                it is to learn a language but this is not a “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks” deal. I started
                beginner’s French about 3 years ago and off and on again I’ve continued to where I’m now in a
                Pre-Advanced class. I’ll probably never be fluent but I know (because I’ve done it) I can go to
                France
                and communicate pretty well with people. I learn something new each class. The instructors are
                committed, they’re patient (they’ve got to be with me…) and if you’re willing to learn…you’ll learn.

            <p>I have come to ILI for two summers to study French. I have attended private classes with Marie
                Claire. The time has been invaluable, positive, fun and very educational. Marie Claire is creative
                as well as very personable and engaging. The class time flies by. Francisco is also very helpful
                about scheduling convenient lessons with an appropriate instructor. He is also flexible about
                changes in a private lesson schedule. I plan to return to my studies at ILI next summer if not
                before.</p>
